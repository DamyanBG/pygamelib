# Security Policy

Security in the pygamelib should not be a big concern since the library does not do anything critical or does not process any data.
However, we are always careful about these questions.

## Supported Versions

Here is how the versions are supported in terms of security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| >= 1.3.x| :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.3.0 | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a found or suspected vulnerability please go to https://github.com/pygamelib/pygamelib/issues and report the vulnerability you found through a "Security Vulnerability" issue. Please make sure that your issue has the security-report tag.

Thank you for your help!
