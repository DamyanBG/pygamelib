Hi,

If you are reading that, it means that you are considering contributing to some open source project during Hacktoberfest. 
That great contgratulations!

If you were to chose to spend your time on the pygamelib project here's what you need to know:

### What is it?

A game library to make console (as in terminal) based games.

### Who is the audience?

Everyone with an interest in game development and terminal based games. Mostly it is supposed to be a library that can be used by novice programers but also provides fun stuff as they grow as developers.

I use it in my Kids Coding Class with kids from age 6 to age 16.

### Who can contributes?

Everyone, just try to pick an issue that is related to your level in Python.

### How to discuss with the community

There is a Discord server: https://discord.gg/ZtVaMqr

### Do I need to know game development?

It's better but not required. I did not know anything about game dev before starting.

### Anything else?

Base branch for PR is either 1.3.0-working or master (I'll keep both in sync).

Have fun!

Arnaud.
