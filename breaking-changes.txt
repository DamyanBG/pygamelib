BoardItem.size() -> BoardItem.inventory_space()
Utils.get_key() -> Game.get_key() and is not static anymore
Utils colored functions : all in base.Text
All Structures are moved to board_items.
Utils.key -> game.key
Projectile: *args replaced by callback_parameters.

Changing a lot of variables into properties to manage internals ?
Sprites are not describing the same thing as before.

1.2.0 -> 1.3.0

BoardItem: type in constructor is now item_type. This breaks a lot of things...
BoardItem: they are now all able to set/get overlappable, restorable, pickable and can_move
BoardItem: value has been moved to BoardItem.
BoardItem: change of behavior: now if both model and sprixel are given to the constructor, model is ignored (sprixel has priority). Need an example in the release note.
[non breaking][important] Void cells are now initialized with knowing their position.
