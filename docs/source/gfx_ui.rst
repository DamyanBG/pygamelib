.. WARNING :: The UI module is in alpha version. Some things might change over time.

The ui module contains the classes to easily build full screen user interface for your
games (or applications).

.. Important:: It works exclusively with the screen buffer system (place, delete,
   render, update, etc.).
   It doesn't work with Screen functions tagged "direct display" like display_at().
